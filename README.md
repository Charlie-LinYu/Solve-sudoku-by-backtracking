# Solve sudoku by backtracking

After specifying the date and the difficulty, this program will extract a sudoku problem from the website: http://cn.sudokupuzzle.org and solve it based on the backtracking algorithm. 

It performs well for some problems, but sometimes, it may take an extremely long time to find the solution. I am trying to learn the Dancing Links X algorithm to solve sudoku.
